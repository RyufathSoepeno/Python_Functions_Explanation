# IT IS A MUST FOR YOU TO USE IDE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND FUNCTIONS



# Examples of functions:
# print(), round()

# You can actually MAKE YOUR OWN functions

# Sometimes we can't put a hundred lines of code into one file,
# rather we should use functions and break those code into smaller maintainable and reusable chunks of code

# def Function_Name

def greet():
    print("Hi There")
    print("Welcome Aboard")

greet()

# With greet(), it is like a button, you can activate it

# Functions do not take inputs
# So you need to "Pass" the inputs to the function by using parameter
# You can add more than two parameters
# def Function_Name(Parameter_Name) in an argument-->()
